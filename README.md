<h3><h3>Security Engineer | SOC Operations • Penetration Testing • Detection Engineering • DFIR • AI Security</h3></h3>

<p>
I am a Security Engineer focused on SOC Operations, Penetration Testing, and Detection Engineering to strengthen enterprise security posture. I proactively identify vulnerabilities through adversarial testing and design high-fidelity detection strategies to counter complex threats. By bridging the gap between offensive emulation, forensic investigation (DFIR), and AI Security, I leverage automation and machine learning to secure emerging technologies, streamline workflows, and accelerate incident response.

<h2>Security Philosophy</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define the Threat Model:</strong> Prioritize risks based on real-world impact, feasibility, and business logic.</li>
<li><strong>Emulate Adversarial Behavior:</strong> Offense informs defense; valid detections and resilient architectures require realistic penetration testing.</li>
<li><strong>Fortify Blue Team Defense:</strong> Implement robust, multi-layered defense-in-depth strategies and maintain continuous visibility to detect and neutralize threats in real-time.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical AI Oversight:</strong> Leverage AI for defensive scale while maintaining transparency and human-in-the-loop accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Automate & Iterate:</strong> Security is a process, not a product; automate the routine to focus on the complex.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Seeking roles in Penetration Testing, Detection Engineering, or SOC Operations where I can bridge the gap between offensive emulation and defensive architecture. I am dedicated to using adversarial insights to engineer high-fidelity detections, automate response, and drive measurable risk reduction.
