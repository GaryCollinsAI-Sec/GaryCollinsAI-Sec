<h3>Security Engineer | SOC Operations • DFIR • Red Teaming • Detection Engineering • AI Security Automation</h3>

<p>
I am a Security Engineer focused on SOC Operations, Red Teaming, and Detection Engineering to strengthen enterprise security posture. I proactively identify vulnerabilities through adversarial testing and design high-fidelity detection strategies to counter complex threats. By bridging the gap between offensive emulation, forensic investigation (DFIR), and AI Security, I leverage automation and machine learning to secure emerging technologies, streamline workflows, and accelerate incident response.
