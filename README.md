**Applied Machine Learning & Cybersecurity Professional | Automation, Detection, Data**

I build AI-driven solutions for security and operational challenges. My work spans applied machine learning, detection engineering, cloud security, and automation, with a strong foundation in software development, network analysis, and cybersecurity. I enjoy solving real-world problems through data, code, and creative system design.

## 🔹 Approach & Philosophy
I approach every project with the mindset of **problem → solution → impact**:  
1. Understand the environment and define the problem clearly.  
2. Apply technical skills (ML, scripting, security tools) to develop solutions.  
3. Measure outcomes, optimize performance, and document results.  

This methodology applies to both **cybersecurity projects** and **AI-driven initiatives**, ensuring practical, actionable, and scalable results.
